Do you want to learn more about patenting and Intellectual Property in the Life Sciences technology? Have you ever thought about the social consequences of biotechnology?

These and other questions will be addressed by our two guest speakers at the Bioethics and Biolegislation Mini-Symposium. Our key speaker, Joanna Appelquist, is an European Patent Attorney from Valea AB and an expert in biomedical and technological patenting. She will tell us all we need to know about intellectual property and how to avoid making mistakes . Furthermore, we will also have the opportunity to learn about the moral trade-offs in the development and use of biotechnology from Jesper Ahlin Marceta, PhD candidate in Philosophy.
