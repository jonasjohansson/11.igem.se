Esther was invented and made possible by this fantastic team of people. With 13 different nationalities, diverse backgrounds, educations, perspectives and ideas, we developed this project. We went from strangers to the creators of Esther in the span of only 9 months, but most importantly we all became great friends for life. This is us: iGEM Stockholm 2019.

**Name:** Nerea Capon

**Team Role:** Team Leader

**School:** Stockholm University

**Program:** MSc. Neurochemistry and Molecular Neurobiology

Nerea chose iGEM because she loved the idea of developing something that could have a use in society or to the science community. She was also attracted to the fact that it was not just a project you develop in a lab and "that's it"; it also has a lot of work behind, such as contacting sponsors or presenting your idea to the general public. This was a side of science that she really wanted to explore!
