> We hosted an art exhibition 25 metres below the surface, home to Swedens first nuclear reactor R1. The theme of the exhibition is Synthetic Biology, a new interdisciplinary area that involves the application of engineering principles to biology. It aims at the (re-)design and fabrication of biological components and systems that do not already exist in the natural world!
