Integrated Human Practices was a key part involved in the development of Esther. Through the opinions of four different sectors we were able to get feedback which enabled us to better shape our product. Later on this was key in the establishment of Esther as a product to be sold to the public and be considered a plausible alternative in the fight of antibiotic resistance.

It is key to consider the status, socially and scientifically, of this treatment method to fully understand how to introduce and develop our product in the accurate and more effective way into society. For this we viewed our project from as many ways possible, considering the importance of ethics and GMOs, perspectives from experts in the area of antibiotic resistance from our 4 different sectors to fully take into account all perspectives, and the entrepreneurial perspective to successfully launch our product into the market.

In our planning for this phase of Human Practices 4 key players were identified.

-   Research
-   General Public
-   Companies
-   Public stakeholders such as physicians and the general health sector.

We also has 3 main goals established as targets we wanted to achieve through our process:

1.

## Documentary

The documentary was a key part of our Integrated HP. Here we talked to experts in the field and created an informative video showing the basics and main goal and functioning of Phage Therapy to further inform the general public of this treatment alternative.

Charles can you write this part please? :)

Meeting with Recipharm

Recipharm is an important sponsor for our project.

## SynthEthics

Due to the real ethical implications of using phage therapy as an actual treatment method this led us to consider the ethics behind synthetic biology and genetic engineering. In collaboration with iGEM Lund this was brainstormed and investigated in order to formulate questions to be sent to the general public and experts. This would enable the recollection of feedback from the general public as well as people, such as researchers specialised in this area. The questions were designed differently according to the target group. They were made yes/no questions for the general public and more in depth questions for the experts in the filed. The objective of this project was to start an initiative to draft a suitable legislation for GMOs.

The feedback obtained was key not only for the future of Synthetic Biology but also regarding the future launch of our product into society.

## Entrepreneurship

The entrepreneurial aspect was an essential part of our project. Not only have we drafted a business plan but also we held an event in Karolinska Institutet to express the importance to spread awareness of entrepreneurial aspect of science and how to bring ideas to life as viable products in the business world.

## Bench to Bedside

This event was held in September 18th 2019 in Karolinska Institutet. It was done in collaboration with iGEM Uppsala. Here our respective projects were introduced, and a formal introduction about iGEM was made. We had a speaker called Anna ———— (I don't remember her name) discussed the journey and how they brought their start-up, (I don't remember the name), to life. Their business idea was introduced and the science behind this was discussed briefly. The goal of this was to provide inspiration to our speakers about how to bring their scientific ideas to life and a well-functioning business, promoting the entrepreneurial and innovative side of science.

After a fika break, we went on to discuss design thinking and learnt about how to actually make a well-functioning product that will fit in well into society. The importance of assessing the problem in depth to fully understand the goal of our product, and prototyping to get effective feedback, were emphasised. Later we went on to create prototypes of either one of the iGEM groups presented and gained some effective insight on how to bring our product to life in an effective way. It was a very creative and fun afternoon where both teams were able to obtain feedback about how to further mould their product to be successful in the market!

For us it helped us visualise our product

Business Plan (see separate tab)

An in depth assessment of our product launch was performed. Please click on our Business Plan tab to get some insight about how we did it!

## WWW

During the World Water Week, we were given the opportunity to introduce our project to professionals in this area and get some specialist views on our work. Further, key feedback was obtained which was of importance in the further shaping of our project. Perspectives upon the functioning in different physiological conditions, such as ¿low pH? , were obtained. Later on in the lab this would be demonstrated by experiments which demonstrated that effectively in these conditions there is no effective response.

Can someone who went there put in more feedback please?
