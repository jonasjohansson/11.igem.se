### Workflow

...

12/6 p15A with kanamycin resistance was chosen as backbone.

12/6 We discovered that ordered biobricks were lacking RBS and Terminators

26/6 Four new updated biobricks arrive with primers that will insert overhangs past the prefix and suffix.

27/6 The growth curve protocol to grow C1757 had an additional step of washing which contaminated my cells.

27/6 Cells were diluted too much, and the Spectrophotometer could not measure below OD 0.1.

28/6 We discover that Our restriction enzymes could not attach to the restriction sites as there were too few basepairs past the prefix and suffix, we order primers that will add overhangs

1/7 We switch from p15A to the C3 and C5 plasmids that have chloramphenicol instead of kanamycin and are easier to handle.

2/7 Amplification optimization with old Q5 enzyme, finding the correct annealing temperature

2/7 After amplification we had many unspecific bands. We used gel purification to a large extent to purify the correct band and lost a lot of DNA.

2/7 Successful growth of C1757

2/7 Competent cells of C1757 cells by CaCl2 treatment, transformation was unsuccessful

2/7 we decided to start using the new bricks

5/7We used very little DNA for ligations and exceeded the total reaction volume recommended by the provider.

5/7 Next Nerea did competent C1757 cells by the KCM protocol and it worked.

6/7 We do ligation with T4 ligase for 10 min according to the provider which did not work.

8/7 Brick 1.2 and Brick 3 are amplified but not brick 1 and 2, we ordered more specific primers

Ute RÃ¶mling our PI notice that we have forgotten to include AraC in constructs containing pBAd.

9/7 We isolate AraC3 construct plate 5 M18 - 3 transformations were unsuccessful

We order primers for overlap extension and will try a different cloning method

10/7 Aman our pHd gave us the advice to do larger PCR reactions, not to purify after digestion, use T4 ligase at 16C overnight and not to exceed the total reaction volume of 20ul and to try different molar rations. And to use much bigger volumes of insert and vector.

11/7 We realize we need empty C3 vector as control and we start to digest C3 with notI.

14/7 We recruit more members to the lab

15/7 We isolate AraC3 from plate 4 well 21E)

16/7-22/7 Eventually we tried to clone all biobricks into either the C3 or AraC3 vector We tried 1:3 ratio and 1:5 ratio and there is a lot of background signaling.

18/7We did restriction cloning of BB1 into the C3 backbone. The colonies appeared red and charactarization started. Sequencing results revealed that we had not inserted our desired brick.

25/7 We ran out of Q5 and used Phusion ad Pfu polymerases to do colony pcr. Pfu PCR was unsuccessful at the chosen annealing temperature. All colonies were negative.

31/7 We tried a new method of colony PCR with an initial cell lysis of colonies at 95 degrees for 10 minutes.

31/7 We now try to dephosphorylate our vector to decrease background signaling.

5/8 We successfully clone brick 1.2 into AraC3 thanks to dephosphorylation.

13/8 When a second biobrick tried to be added only half of the brick was inserted, suggesting that there were some shorter fragments in the mix.

19/8 We decrease the time of digestion from 2h to 15 min to minimize star activity

26/8 We see in an agarose gel that amplification of BB3 suddenly produces some shorter unspecific bands.

3/9 Some of the previous positive colonies of AraC3 BB1.2, were cultured and the plasmids isolated. After sequencing it appeared there was an extensive deletion in the RFP sequence and 2-3 new stopcodons had appeared.

9/9 Johan our PI recommends that we change the cloning assembly technique and that we should refrain from doing overlap extension since it is less likely you will get it to work with short overlaps.

11/9 Transformation with NEB hiFi assembly kit

20/9 Successful cloning of our bricks
