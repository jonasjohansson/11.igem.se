## Understanding the issue

The antibiotic era started in 1928, with the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming, which brought many benefits to our society. In the early 20th century the life expectancy in the US was only 56.4 years. Today this number has increased to nearly 80 years, thanks to antibiotics, amongst other factors. But during recent years, our society has encountered two major threats to this fantastic treatment: 1. Antibiotic resistance has increased and continues to do so, and 2. The discovery of new antibiotics is decreasing.

Antibiotic resistance is the result of multiple factors, such as overuse, lack of diagnosis, incorrect prescribing, and aggressive agricultural use. To make the situation even worse, the amount of new antibiotics has dramatically decreased from 30 molecules discovered in the 80s to 7 in the early 2000s. (1) Many pharmaceutical companies, such as Novartis and AstraZeneca, are withdrawing their antibiotic programs, leaving the general population without an effective solution.

## Seeking alternatives

So, how could we provide a solution? Looking for an alternative, we began to brainstorm and stumbled upon Phage Therapy, which caught our attention because of its multiple applications. Searching for research groups in this area, we found Anders Nilsson’s research group at Stockholm University. His group specializes in bacteriophage research to better understand these viruses, and he had written some articles about Phage Therapy, although never worked directly on this application. Members from our team met with Anders and Elisabeth Haggård-Ljungquist, a retired professor and scientist who had spent her career studying the P2 temperate phage.

## The becoming of Esther

Elisabeth had done her research during the 70s, 80s, and 90s, a time where antibiotic resistance was not such a pressing threat. She found many obstacles to perform her research with bacteriophages, and when she went abroad to continue with her work, she also found barriers as being a woman in science. Her stories, words, and tips not only helped us gain a better understand of the P2 phage and its switch; she also inspired us to keep trying despite all possible obstacles.

As an ode to the famous microbiologist and expert in phages, Esther Lederberg, and after all the women in science that like Elisabeth, keep fighting no matter the obstacles, we have named our project, Esther.
