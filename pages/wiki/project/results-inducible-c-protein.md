## Background

The rationale behind this brick was to create an inducible C-protein construct where the levels of C-protein could easily be manipulated.

## Aims

-   Characterize the C-protein expression levels upon various concentrations of arabinose induction.

## Achievements

-   Red fluorescence was not detected, neither with or without arabinose induction.
-   Unspecific binding of our antibody prevented detection by westernblot.

## Results

Similarly to the C-protein characterization construct, we created a composite part where C-protein can be regulated with the arabinose inducible promoter pBad. There were very little written in the litterature about the expression of C-protein from its native promoter Pc. We knew that the pTet promoter i strong but we didnt know if perhaos the level of C-protein would be toxic or not enough. Were it that the pTet promoter was either too weak or two strong, we could asses the appropriate C protein levels by combining this part with the phage simulation construct. (shown below)
