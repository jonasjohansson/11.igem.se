## Background

This plasmid was designed in order to investigate at which level of expression C-protein inhibits the Pe promoter. We wanted to see if we could find the threshold where there is sufficient level of C-protein to keep phages in lysogeny and if this expression level was achieved by the pTet constitutive promoter.

## Aims

-   The aim of this plasmid is to investigate at what level of C-protein expression there is a quenching of the Pe promoter.

## Achievements

-   The model plasmid was constructed using the hiFi cloning kit. Plasmid sequences were defective.

## Results

We expect that the native cox promoter Pe expresses cox at moderate levels as this is what we found in the litterature. Since we know that C protein can negitively inhibit the Pe promoter to force phages to stay in lysogeny we were curious to see what influence the C-protein have on the Pe promoter. We also wanted to see if we could find a threshold where C-protein quenches the expression from Pe. If we compare relative RFP expressions we hope to tell whether the C protein expression in the C protein characterization construct, is above or below the threshold for Pe. This would have given us valuable insights and data to share with the modeling team.

Additionally, if we could show that an overexpression of C has an influence on the native P2 regulatory promoter we could use this as a proof of concept or implication as to how our system would have affected the phages. In this model, the quenching of YFP signal would be a sign of lysogeny.
