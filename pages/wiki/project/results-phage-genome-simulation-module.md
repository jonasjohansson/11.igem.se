## Background

-   This biobrick contains cox gene under its native promoter, Pe, as in the P2 phage genome. This enabled us to investigate the level of cox expressed by this promoter over time.
-   The brick mimics a small part of the P2 regulatory switch region and can therefore be combined with other bricks to test the external influence on cox expression. See model plasmid.

## Aims

-   Analyze the level of expression of cox from the natural P2 promoter Pe.

## Achievements

-   Cox expression was absent in the western blot.
-   We were not able to detect YFP in the plate reader
