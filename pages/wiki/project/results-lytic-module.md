## Background

-   pBad pormoter, inducible with addition of arabinose (mimics an external stimulus)
-   pBad induction drives expression of: TetR, cox-fused with cMyc, GFP as a reporter of induction

## Aims

Here we aim to assess the expression of cox through westernblot and fluorometry at different levels of pBad induction.

## Achievements

-   We successfully cloned the composite part in araC3 vector part using HiFi DNA assembly kit
-   We did not achieve to see GFP signal nor detect cMyc on WB upon arabinose induction

## Results

Here we wanted to put cox under the control of an inducible promoter in order to experimentally regulate the induction of cox and the degree of its expression. This was of importance as cox is the other main regulator of the P2 transcriptional switch. In order for our system to work the expression analysis needed to be well defined and we needed to understand if at any level, cox expression would be saturated. Therefore, cox was fused with a c-myc tag that enabled us to stain for the protein in a westernblot. Additionally, cox was coupled with the transcription of a reporter protein, GFP. We wanted to create a profile to assess the protein expression of cox and GFP respectively at different arabinose concentrations. We wanted to validate if cox and GFP were expressed from our construct to the same degree. Cells containing this construct were grown in permissive and non-permissive conditions and samples were collected at stationary phase and analyzed by westernblot.

Altough, there are no way to directly measure TetR expression we included TetR in this biobrick as it was essential that the inhibitor was regulated from the same inducible promoter and would activate at the same stimuli. For the final system to work we needed TetR to be included in the composite part.

The western blot experiment of the inducible cox construct showed that cox is not expressed. It was therefore hard to evaluate whether the expression would have increased with increasing amount of arabinose.
