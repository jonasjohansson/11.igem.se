> All work included in this project, unless otherwise specified, has been carried out, analyzed and reported by the iGEM Stockholm 2019 team. However, despite all our evident work and effort, these achievements could not have been possible without the support of all our supervisors, instructors, and advisors. Therefore, we want to deeply thank them for all their support and guidance on this page. Each of them has contributed to different chapters of our whole story, we hope you have enjoyed it as we did.

## Acknowledgments

## SGEM - Stockholm iGEM alumni

We would like to thank all the SGEM members and the board of this Non Profit Organization, who provided us support and help throughout the year in multiple ways: they organized workshops to share the different skills they have learned during their iGEM years, they provided us financial help, organized fun events for us, provided us feedback and a valuable network of alumni that were ready to help us. They were a key contributor to the recruitment process, and without them, the continuous existence of iGEM Stockholm would not be possible.

## Special thanks

We want to thank other iGEM teams and members that we have met throughout this year, for the fun times that we spent with them and their initiatives to organize events, so that we could meet more iGEMers. Especially, iGEM South Denmark University, for organizing the Biobrick Workshop; iGEM Copenhagen, for organizing the Nordic iGEM Conference; iGEM Vilnius for organizing and covering the expenses for us to attend the Biohackathon; and iGEM Bonn, for organizing the iGEM Spring Bonn Festival and for inviting us to have our meme seminar.

Thank you Beckmans college of design for lending your facilities for meetings, project video documentation and internal events.

Thank you as well to all the teams that collaborated with us, such as iGEM Eindhoven, iGEM Lund, iGEM Uppsala, and their delicious crayfish dinner, iGEM Technion, iGEM Carroll HS, and iGEM Dusseldorf.

Also a big thanks to Mindaugas Raitelaitis**,** a former member of iGEM Stockholm 2019 who has helped tremendously during the initial brainstorming and project development, as well as the Safety issues around working with the P2 phage.

Last, but not least, we would like to thank our former iGEM Stockholm 2019 Team Leader, Eden Black, for his tremendous help during the first months of our iGEM journey, and his enormous dedication to the design our project. You helped build up our team and inspired all of us with your dedication and determination. Esther would not have been possible without you.

## Team Training and Project Start

The iGEM project is not part of any synthetic biology course, and joining the team is voluntary. The team first met at the end of January and started a 3-month brainstorming period. In April, the project was chosen, and the team dedicated all their pre-summer time to plan their lab time efficiently and organize educational and engagement events. Over the summer, the team got free access to the course labs of KTH Royal Institute of Technology. After the summer, our team was kindly granted access to lab space of the Department of Protein Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology to continue their experiments.
