> We want to thank all our official sponsors and private donors for their generous contributions. Esther would not have been possible without their support. We are very grateful to have many corporate sponsors on board again with our 2019 team. And because small contributions can make a big difference, we would also like to thank all the backers of our crowdfunding campaign.
