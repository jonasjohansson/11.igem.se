# Esther

The woman that revolutionized microbiology.

Esther Lederberg is an icon in science, especially in bacterial genetics. She discovered the first temperate phage to be reported, the lambda phage, which has become a widespread tool for studying genetic recombination and gene expression, and a model for disease caused by viruses with a temperate cycle. She laid the groundwork for demonstrating how phages can transfer genes between bacteria through a process called "transduction".

Not only did this remarkable woman discover temperate phages, she also discovered the F- fertile factor, a plasmid that allows for bacterial conjugation - this is, the transfer of genetic material between two bacteria through direct contact, and not through a phage, which is the case of transduction. Furthermore, she also designed a technique to screen multiple bacteria phenotypes through different conditions, called replica plating.

As you can see, Esther made extraordinary contributions to microbiology and bacterial genetics, but her work was not always properly recognized. In 1958, his Husdband Joshua Lederberg received a Nobel prize for the discovery of bacterial conjugation, although his wife was never mentioned. He is also often referred to as the researcher who discovered bacterial transduction, albeit this wouldn't have been possible without Esther's discovery of the Lambda phage.

Her work was impeccable, "an experimental and methodological genius in the lab", but as a woman doing STEM in the 60s and 70s, she often struggled to even get a job. She was able to obtain a position at Stanford University, for which she was overqualified and was not even paid.

## Esther & Phage Therapy

Mention something about antibiotic resistance.

Our goal in iGEM Stockholm is to bring the temperate phages back to explore their full potential. Phage therapy has been gaining more attention over the years, as the antibiotic crisis becomes more noticeable. Phages offer an excellent alternative to antibiotics, as they also kill bacteria that cause infections. Nevertheless, phage therapy has focused on the use of lytic phages -these are, phages that cannot "hide" in bacteria's DNA.

**Phage therapy vs. antibiotics**

There are several reasons why one would prefer phage therapy over antibiotics.

Antibiotics cause resistance, not only in targeted bacteria

Many side effects, especially with stronger antibiotics

Phages are less likely to cause resistance

High specificity means that the patients gut microbiome does not suffer as much from treatment

# Esther: The new phage therapy

-   Encapsulated bacteria containing prophages can bypass the gastric system and safely be delivered to the intestine whereupon bacteria are released from the capsid
-   The sensing system recognizes gut inflammation and triggers in the presence of an infection
-   The prophages are synthesized in the delivery bacteria - ensuring on site production of high phage titters
-   The prophages are specific for enteric pathogens such as EHEC and does not infect mammalian cells
-   There are few antibodies present in the intestinal lumen and therefore less of a risk that the patient can develop an immune reaction toward the treatment. Increasing the likelyhood that it would not be a one time treatment
-   Activation within the intestine also ensures a decreased risk of developed resistance
-   The prophage has been genetically engineered to prevent lysogenization within the pathogenic strain.
-

Esther provides a solution that will increase the effectiveness of treatment and ensure that the effective dose is increased.
