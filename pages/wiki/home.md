Esther Lederberg is an icon in science, especially in bacterial genetics. She discovered the first reported temperate phage, the lambda phage, which has become a popular tool for studying genetic recombination and gene expression, and a model for disease caused by viruses with a temperate cycle. She laid the groundwork for demonstrating how phages can transfer genes between bacteria through a process called "transduction".

Not only did this remarkable woman discover temperate phages, but also the F- fertile factor, a plasmid that allows for bacterial conjugation - this is, the transfer of genetic material between two bacteria through direct contact, and not through a phage, which is the case of transduction. Furthermore, she also designed a technique to screen multiple bacteria phenotypes through different conditions, called replica plating.

As you can see, Esther made extraordinary contributions to microbiology and bacterial genetics, but her work was not always correctly recognised. In 1958, her husband Joshua Lederberg received a Nobel prize for the discovery of bacterial conjugation, although his wife was not mentioned. He is also often referred to as the researcher who discovered bacterial transduction, albeit this wouldn't have been possible without Esther's discovery of the Lambda phage.
