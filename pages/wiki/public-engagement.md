## Art Exhibition _13-15 May_

For many, science and art are considered vastly distant from one another, but a scientist knows that their work requires individual artistry, and an artist in many ways understand the science within their art. The Synthetic Biology Art Exhibition took place 13-15th of May in Stockholm, 25 meters below the surface in the old nuclear reactor R1. Artistic expressions from all corners were accepted, everything from audiovisual video works to petri-dish multiplayer experiences. Some were funny and beautiful, while others were disturbing and thought-provoking. Everyone was eligible to participate regardless of the artistic prowess or expertise of synthetic biology. From the artworks submitted, 5 winners were rewarded with a presentation in Osqledaren online (KTH magazine) as well as Medicor online (KI magazine).

## Lab-on-wheels _Science can be done by anyone!_

An interactive workshop, organized as part of the Art Exhibition, where participants would extract DNA from üçì with everyday items such as dish soap, salt, rubbing alcohol, plastic bags, coffee filter, and toothpicks. When done, the visitors could keep their extracted DNA in an Eppendorf tube!

When speaking about DNA, we have found that the idea of it is too abstract. In the lab-on-wheels session, we invited visitors to isolate DNA and hold it in their hands. We also demonstrated general lab equipment such as pipettes and microtubes so they could experience the lab atmosphere. The strawberries were crushed inside a plastic bag together with a mixture of water, salt, and dish soap. The mixture was finally filtered through a coffee filter to retrieve the DNA in the strawberry juice. The visitors could see their isolated DNA inside the microtube after ethanol addition.

## 3 Demo Project _What do you know about bacteria?_

Synthetic biology is, relatively speaking, a new field of science and so the general knowledge is low. In order to make an impact we wanted to inspire and inform youth, and so we travelled to Link√∂ping where we visited Atlasskolan and met with a total of 100 students ages 6 to 12! We know that talking is not the best way to build excitement, and synthetic biology is hands-on, so we prepared two exercises; Learning about microscopes and drawing bacteria.

We asked the classes "what do you know about bacteria?", and followed up with a short lesson which led to great discussions about the central dogma, replication and epigenetics. These kids are not to be taken lightly‚Ä¶

Then followed our two exercices, observing bacteria through microscope and then drawing artistic and conceptual versions on top of a provided template. Most of the children drew bacteria that killed people (yikes!), but some made friendly bacteria. Bacteria has got a really bad rap!

Creating a fun and engaging introduction to Synthetic Biology is a great challenge, and something we would like to continue developing. We had a great experience at Atlasskolan and experienced a <sup>high</sup> sense of engagement and curiousity, one of the children even asked it was possible to join!

## PIXID Card Game

Synthetic Biology should be fun and interactive, therefore we created a new game to interact with the non-scientific community. Since iGEM Stockholm 2018 team had some great input with their boardgame "Plasmido", we decided to launch a new card game called Pixid!

Pixid name is originally form Pix = Picture and Id = it. This means picture it !

So people will give their answer based on the provided pictures on the cards.

This is tool for us to engage people not only with science background, but also public in general.

Pixid is accessible to all generations and to players with different cultural background as the cards are picture-based. The game aims at raising attention and awareness around antibiotic resistance. Some basic questions like "What represents sickness to you?" are asked to the players. The questions become more specific to our project as we can collect feedback from people how they think about our project as we ask about their familiarity to bacteriophage therapy until how they want it to get the treatment if we can produce it in large scale. Scoring board is provided, the player will be given point if their answer is one of the possible answers. The best answer chosen from the survey will be given 2 points. Some players added that this media is so powerful and fun as they are challenged to get the highest point.

For children, these cards can be used as memory game. As they play the game, we can also raise their awareness about the antibiotic resistance by telling story about the bacteria and our project.

## Bioethics and Biolegislation

Last May 29th we got the chance to learn about biotechnological innovation and bioethics in an event organized by our iGEM Stockholm team. The event took place at Stockholm University, thanks to the collaboration with the SU-Young Faculty Professors Association. We were very fortunate to have Joanna Applequist, an European Patent Attorney from Valea AB; and Jesper Ahlin Merceta, an expert in Bioethics, from KTH Royal Institute of Technology; as our guest speakers.

Joanna Applequist gave us an introduction to intellectual property and provided an overview of aspects to consider when pursuing a patent for an invention. She also explained to us the patentability criteria focusing on the life science field and talked about the process of drafting and prosecuting patent applications. Importantly, Joanna provided a list of do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts for inventors who wanted to secure intellectual property rights to their technology.

On the other hand, Jesper discuss some moral trade-offs in the development and use of biotechnology. We discussed how should the possibilities of biotechnology, such as making human beings resistant to harmful or deadly viruses, be weighed against moral constraints such as, for instance, not using fetuses for research purposes. He also made us question ourselves about the values are at stake and how should society deal with such moral trade-offs.
