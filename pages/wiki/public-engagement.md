## Lab-on-wheels

“Lab on wheels”, an interactive workshop for visitors. The workshop consisted of extracting DNA from strawberries with everyday items you can find in your kitchen. For example, instead of a centrifuge machine, a plastic bag with manual crushing was used. When done, the visitors were allowed to keep their extracted DNA in an Eppendorf tube to take home and show family and friends. This event was done deep down in the nuclear reactor, more specifically in the control room, iGEM Stockholms while we exhibited synthetic art.

The reason why we gave the workshop because the idea of DNA is abstract for people in general, how it looks like and how we can see it. In the lab-on-wheels session, we gave them a chance to try out how it feels to isolate DNA and hold it in your hand. Using simple materials and tools that we can find in our house such as strawberries, dish soap, salt, rubbing alcohol, plastic bags, coffee filter, and tooth picks. We also showed them some general lab equipment such as pipettes and microtubes so they could still feel the working-in-a-lab atmosphere. The strawberries were crushed inside a plastic bag together with a mixture of water, salt, and dish soap. The mixture was finally filtered through a coffee filter to retrieve the DNA in the strawberry juice. The visitors could see their isolated DNA inside the microtube after ethanol addition.

People who came tho the lab-on-wheel booth were super excited and complimented that science is fun ! We also tell them that this is a glimpse of what we are doing in the lab so they can feel how is it to work in wetlab but using common materials that they can find in their house. This also shows people that science can be done by anyone !

## 3 Demo Project

We visited an elementary school and spoke to 6 classes about synthetic biology. The purpose of the visit was to gauge the knowledge of young kids as well as educate them on the topic of synthetic biology.

The class began with an introduction of ourselves and the question “What do you know about bacteria”. The classes seemed to know that they are small, single celled things that can make you sick, some even knew that they can cure infections and some knew of the cells subunits.

Then followed a lesson on bacteria and its subunits, the interest in this part was positive and there were a lot of questions that lead to dialogues about the central dogma, replication and epigenetics. Then followed the exercise, which was to study bacteria under a microscope and drawing. The microscope study recieved a lot of interest, but in practise was complicated, while the drawing exercise was much appreciated once the kids understood the idea.

Then we spoke about iGEM and the previous Stockholm iGEM teams. They seemed to think the projects were really inspiring but did not seem to register the problems that the projects attempted to handle. In general, the interest was peaked, a kid asked how and when they can join!

Finally we spoke about our project. They seemed engaged in learning about the problem, although they might not have understood it. The images seemed to assist in their understanding.

The visit was an overall success, the school appreciated our visit, the kids seemed to really like us.

## PIXID Card Game

Synthetic Biology should be fun and interactive, therefore we created a new game to interact with the non-scientific community. Since iGEM Stockholm 2018 team had some great input with their boardgame "Plasmido", we decided to launch a new card game called Pixid!

Pixid name is originally form Pix = Picture and Id = it. This means picture it !

So people will give their answer based on the provided pictures on the cards.

This is tool for us to engage people not only with science background, but also public in general.

Pixid is accessible to all generations and to players with different cultural background as the cards are picture-based. The game aims at raising attention and awareness around antibiotic resistance. Some basic questions like "What represents sickness to you?" are asked to the players. The questions become more specific to our project as we can collect feedback from people how they think about our project as we ask about their familiarity to bacteriophage therapy until how they want it to get the treatment if we can produce it in large scale. Scoring board is provided, the player will be given point if their answer is one of the possible answers. The best answer chosen from the survey will be given 2 points. Some players added that this media is so powerful and fun as they are challenged to get the highest point.

For children, these cards can be used as memory game. As they play the game, we can also raise their awareness about the antibiotic resistance by telling story about the bacteria and our project.

## Art Exhibition

For most people, science and art are two completely different fields. But a scientist knows that their work requires a certain artistic feel to it, and an artist knows the science behind their creation. Today different fields are merging together, creating new ones. Such is the field of Biotechnology and genetic engineering. As a part of the international genetic engineering competition iGEM, team Stockholm decided to celebrate this intersection of genetic engineering, biotech and art by hosting an open call art exhibition, with synthetic biology as the main theme. Not only did we decide to host this epic art event in a shut down nuclear reactor for the fun of it, we also aimed to educate the public about what exactly genetic engineering is and create an open discussion on the subject with art as the tool for communication. Featured in this booklet is all the artwork contributed to the art exhibition that took place the 13th-15th of May 2019 in R1. R1 is the first nuclear reactor in Sweden that today is shut down and used for similar art events, 25 meters under the Royal Institute of Technology, KTH.

All kinds of art was accepted, everything from audiovisual video works to petridish multiplayer experiences. Some may be funny and beautiful, others disturbing and thought provoking. Everyone was eligible to participate irregardless of artistic level or experience of synthetic biology. From the 38 artworks submitted, 5 winners were chosen from the 2019 iGEM Stockholm team based on creativity, innovation and personal motivations. The winners, with one Grand prize winner, were rewarded a presentation in Osqledaren online (KTH magazine) as well as Medicor online (KI magazine). The five winners are also highlighted in the first pages of this booklet. Furthermore, each booklet contains a unique artwork as a poster, so that the reader may hang up artworks at home, and relive some of the magic created at the art exhibition. We hope these artworks will inspire you to start thinking about synthetic biology in new ways and open up for discussion. Posing the question; where does science end and art begin?

## Bioethics and Biolegislation

Last May 29th we got the chance to learn about biotechnological innovation and bioethics in an event organized by our iGEM Stockholm team. The event took place at Stockholm University, thanks to the collaboration with the SU-Young Faculty Professors Association. We were very fortunate to have Joanna Applequist, an European Patent Attorney from Valea AB; and Jesper Ahlin Merceta, an expert in Bioethics, from KTH Royal Institute of Technology; as our guest speakers.

Joanna Applequist gave us an introduction to intellectual property and provided an overview of aspects to consider when pursuing a patent for an invention. She also explained to us the patentability criteria focusing on the life science field and talked about the process of drafting and prosecuting patent applications. Importantly, Joanna provided a list of do’s and don’ts for inventors who wanted to secure intellectual property rights to their technology.

On the other hand, Jesper discuss some moral trade-offs in the development and use of biotechnology. We discussed how should the possibilities of biotechnology, such as making human beings resistant to harmful or deadly viruses, be weighed against moral constraints such as, for instance, not using fetuses for research purposes. He also made us question ourselves about the values are at stake and how should society deal with such moral trade-offs.
