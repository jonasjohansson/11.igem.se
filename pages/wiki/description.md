The problem regarding antibiotics is well known within the [iGEM community](# 'CITATION'). Naturally, interest in finding alternatives to antibiotics has risen over the past decade. One option that has never fully utilized is phage therapy. Typically, Phage therapy entails administering a cocktail of bacteriophages to the patient. These bacteriophages target and infect a particular strain of pathogenic bacteria, which is destroyed when the phage multiplies itself within its target. However, despite its high potential, phage therapy is rarely used, as only low concentrations of phages reach the site of infection. Esther revises standard phage therapy. Instead of using virulent (lytic) phages, we propose the use of temperate (lysogenic) phages, that will remain dormant until they have arrived upon the site of infection. Only then will the phages turn lytic and start their lytic cycle. As one of the main issues with temperate phages is the chance of becoming lysogenic after infecting the target bacteria, we tackle this issue by using a carrier bacteria system. Here, the lysogenic phages lack the gene required to keep them in this lysogenic state. Which will be presented by the carrier bacteria instead. By doing so, the phage will only be lysogenic in the carrier bacteria, as any other target bacteria would not have the gene required for this state.

## Phage therapy _Lowering the burden put on antibiotics_

Antibiotics, at the time of their discovery, were a miracle for public health and science. Since then, antibiotics are nearing their expiration date and are becoming obsolete due to the resistance development in bacteria. The World Health Organisation recommends we focus on sanitation, optimizing our use, and that we educate ourselves on the issue of antibiotic resistance. Recommendations that would give us time, but not solve the problem with resistance increasing with every use of antibiotics. Antibiotics are not a sustainable treatment, but phage therapy, on the other hand, is. Phages and bacteria have, since the beginning of the existence of bacteria, co-evolved. Developing a new phage that targets resistant bacteria is, in this sense, much easier than developing a new, broad range antibiotic. This coevolution ensures sustainability.

### So how does phage therapy work? And what problems does it face?

In phage therapy, a patient is given lytic bacteriophages through oral intake or spread on infected surface wounds. As phages are very specific and often the exact bacterial strain causing the infection is unknown, a cocktail of different, common phages are used.

When taken orally, the phages disperse in the body. The majority of phages are extinguished by our immune system, some are degraded due to the high acidity of the stomach, while some attach to circulating bacterial cell debris and thus activate prematurely. As the phages are specific for bacteria, no harm is done to human cells in this process. Even so, the amount of phages reaching their intended target diminishes due to this spreading through the human body.

Thus far, mixed results have been reported on the effectiveness of phage therapy, with [hospitals in Georgia claiming high success rates](# 'CITATION'), whereas [western studies have a more critical look at the efficiency](# 'CITATION').

## Phage life cycles

To fully understand the idea and potential of phage therapy, it is essential to know that there are two types of phages; lytic (viral) and lysogenic (temperate). Each comes with some distinct features.

### Lytic cycle

When a phage follows the lytic cycle, it injects its DNA into a host for amplification. Inside, the phage (or rather, its DNA) makes use of the host's cell machinery to amplify their DNA and create new phage particles. These phage particles then self-assemble into new phages and keep on doing so until the bacterial host bursts, thus causing lysis of its host. The newly formed phages are later released and will repeat this cycle over and over. [[2]](# 'Howard-Varona C, et al., SME J. 2017 Jul; 11(7): 1511â€“1520')

### Lysogenic cycle

Temperate phages also follow this lytic cycle. However, in some cases, the phage will go into the lysogenic cycle. Instead of directly amplifying its DNA, the phage integrates its DNA into the bacterial genome. By doing so, no new phages are created directly, but the phage DNA (now called a prophage) is replicated with the bacteria simultaneously with its host. Upon a particular stimulus, often environmental factors damaging the bacterial DNA, the prophage is released from its host, once again starting the lytic cycle. [2]

Our project makes use of the temperate phage, because of its dormant properties. To get into the details of how we plan to (ab)use this system, continue to our project [Design (JooAnaAnd)](https://www.notion.so/f4c539ce-3452-45f2-80bb-8dc169a7f65f)!
