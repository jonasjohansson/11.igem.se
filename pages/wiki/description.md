## Introducing: Esther

The problem around antibiotics are well known within the iGEM community [citation needed]. Naturally, interest in finding alternatives to antibiotics has risen over the past decade. One alternative that has been around but was never fully utilized is phage therapy.

Typically, Phage therapy entails administering a cocktail of bacteriophages to the patient. These bacteriophages target and infect a very specific strain of pathogenic bacteria, which is destroyed when the phage multiplies itself within its target. However, despite its high potential, phage therapy is rarely used, as only low concentrations of phages reach the site of infection.

With our project - Esther - iGEM Stockholm 2019 revises standard phage therapy. Instead of using virulent (lytic) phages, we propose the use of temperate phages, that will remain dormant until they have arrived upon the site of infection. Only then will the phages turn lytic and start their lytic cycle. As one of the main issues with temperate phages is the chance of turning lysogenic after infecting the target bacteria, we have resolved this issue by using a system in which the phage no longer has the gene required to turn lysogenic as soon as the carrier bacteria is lysed.

## Phage therapy; Lowering the burden put on antibiotics

Antibiotics, at the time of their discovery, were a miracle for public health and science. However, since then antibiotics started nearing their expiration date and is today becoming obsolete due to the resistance development in bacteria. WHO recommends we focus on sanitation, optimizing our use and that we educate ourselves on the issue of antibiotic resistance\*. This is a good solution for today, but the development of resistance increases with every use of antibiotics - antibiotics is not a sustainable treatment but Phage therpy on the other hand, is. Phages and bacteria has, since the beginning of the existance of bacteria, coevolved. Developing a new phage that targets a resistant bacteria is, in this sense, much easier than developing a new, broad range antibiotic. This coevolution ensures sustainablility - unlike the development of antibiotics. [1]

_So how does phage therapy actually works? And what problems does it face?_

In phage therapy, a patient is given lytic bacteriophages by means of oral intake or spread on infected surface wounds. As phages are very specific and often the exact bacterial strain causing the infection is unknown, a cocktail of different, common phages is used.

When taken orally, the phages disperse in the body. the majority of phages are extinquished by our immune system, some are degraded due to the high acidity of stomach. Some phages attach to circulating bacterial cell debris and thus activate prematurely. As the phages are specific for bacteria, no harm is done to human cells in this process. Even so, the amount of phages reaching their intended target diminishes due to this spreading through the human body.

Thus far, mixed results have been reported on the effectiveness of phage therapy, with hospitals in Georgia claiming high success rates, whereas western studies have a more critical look on the effectiveness. [citation needed]

## Phage life cycles

To fully understand the idea and potential of phage therapy, it is important to know that there are two types of phages; lytic (viral) and lysogenic (temperate). Each type comes with some distinct features.

## Lytic cycle

When a phage follows the lytic cycle, it injects its DNA into a host for amplification. Inside, the phage (or rather, its DNA) makes use of the host's cell machinery to amplify their DNA and create new phage particles. These phage particles then self-assemble into new phages, and keep on doing so until the bacterial host bursts, thus causing lysis of its host. The newly formed phages are then released and will repeat this cycle over and over. [2]

## Lysogenic cycle

Temperate phages also follow this lytic cycle. However, in some cases, the phage will go into the lysogenic cycle. Instead of directly amplifying its DNA, the phage integrates its DNA into the bacterial genome. By doing so, no new phages are created directly, but the phage DNA (now called a prophage) is replicated with the bacteria simultaneously with its host. Upon a certain stimulus, often environmental factors damaging the bacterial DNA, the prophage is released from its host, once again starting the lytic cycle.[2]

Our project makes use of the temperate phage, because if its dormant properties. To get into the details of how we plan to (ab)use this system, continue to our project [Design (JooAnaAnd)](https://www.notion.so/f4c539ce-3452-45f2-80bb-8dc169a7f65f)!
