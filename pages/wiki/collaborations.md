Convince the judges you have significantly worked with one (or more) currently registered 2019 iGEM team(s) in a meaningful way. For example, mentor a team (or be mentored by a team), characterize a part, troubleshoot a project, host a meetup, model/simulate a system, or validate a software/hardware solution to a synthetic biology problem.Document your collaboration in detail on your wiki. Judges will look at your collaborator's wiki to see what they say about your interaction. Simply filling out a survey for a team is not enough to demonstrate a significant interaction.
