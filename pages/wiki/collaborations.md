The opportunity for inter-team collaboration within the iGEM community is exciting! During our project, we have collaborated with different iGEM teams, and we did not only benefit from each other‚Äôs expertise, but we also formed invaluable bonds. With this in mind, we would like to thank all the teams who have collaborated and shared ideas with us.

## BioBrick at DTU Copenhagen

In April, we were invited by DTU Copenhagen to participate in a BioBrick tutorial where many nordic teams gathered to learn about which cloning standards to follow, how to use 3A assembly to assemble the bricks and also a team sharing session. The practical lab experience, pitching workshop, and a seminar on creating the wiki page effectively helped us in creating our own. This was an ideal opportunity to connect, especially with the iGEM teams of Lund, Copenhagen, and Uppsala, which we continued collaborating with. The professional network nurtured and in some aspects, initiated will be a continued source of value for our future iGEM teams.

## Bonn Spring Festival

Did you know that the term ‚Äúmemetics‚Äù was first proposed by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in 1976? He then offered a theory regarding how cultural information evolves and is transmitted from person to person. iGEM Spring Festival, organized by iGEM Bonn celebrated this by using memes to communicate science. iGEM Memes has gained much attention over the last year, all thanks to the creator, iGEM Stockholm 2018. We seized the moment to present our project-poster and gained valuable feedback, along with several great memes to add to the collection üé≠

## NIC _Nordic iGEM Conference_

In beautiful June, as studies end and lab work begins, the Copenhagen team hosted the Nordic iGEM conference NiC. All Nordic teams that took part were allowed to pitch their project, practice being on stage, and receive feedback from their peers. This was one of the first opportunities to present to a broad audience of scientific minds. Exciting! Beyond the pitch, there was also a poster exhibition and presentation, and apart from the professional feedback we received, we were able to make friends, some of which turned into strong collaborations like the ones with Lund for Synthethics and Uppsala for Bench to Bedside event.

## Synthetics(R)

In a collaboration between Stockholm and Lund we began the international initative Synthethics(R). An event posing ethical questions to raise awareness within biology and genetic engineering. The desired outcome? To discover the potential risks that the new-era biotechnology and medicine might have in store for us. Synthetic biology is a promising field and has a potentially prosperous future, but it entails areas of research that expose us to severe risks and detrimental outcomes. Therefore, we were avid to gather the opinions of people from all professions, cultures, and ideologies. We customized a set of questions that represented a fraction of the possible dilemmas for both experts in this field and the general public. They were requested to delve into their imagination when answering the questions.

## Bench to Bedside

The expression "Bench to bedside" literally means the translation of clinical research and explorations into commercial products for human welfare. With this vision, we collaborated with iGEM Uppsala to organize a bio-entrepreneurship event at Karolinska Institutet to promote entrepreneurship in iGEM. The inspiring talk by our keynote speaker, Anna Svantes, a business developer at Organofuel Sweden AB and a prototyping workshop facilitated by a design thinking coach resulted in valuable outcomes. Some of these were seeking synergies between the two different projects to promote a sense of greater good and building basic prototypes that could be potentially used as a framework for a prospective minimum viable product.
