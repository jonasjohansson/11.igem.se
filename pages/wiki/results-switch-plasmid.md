## Background

-   This plasmid was designed to be a functional system were one stimulus would trigger a switch in the expression from predominantly C-protein to the activation of cox protein expression.

## Aims

-   To characterize the relative expression of C and cox with and without pBad induction as well as during different levels of induction.

## Achievements

-   We successfully combined two composite parts in the switch plasmid using hifi DNA assembly.
-   Characterization shows an increase in Cox upon arabinose induction.

## Results

It is expected that in the absence of arabinose, the expression of C-protein is high and there is a signature RFP signal. When arabinose is added, we expect an increase in the cox protein expression and a clear shift to GFP signaling. The inducible pBAd promoter would help us to assess at what level of induction we have sufficient expression of the TetR protein, and apropritate negative regulation of C protein expression, from the C protein expression module. We evaluated this effect measuring the level of reporters RFP and GFP by using a multichromatic filter in the fluorescent plate reader.

Top10 cells were transformed with the Switch plasmid and diluted to OD 0.05 in a 96-well plate. Cells were grown for 6 hours at 37C. Multi-chromatic setting measured both RFP and GFP at 5 min intervals. Flourescein was used as a positive control for GFP. It became clear that over the course of 6 hours, no flourescence was detected. The intensity did not differ significantly from the negative control nor did the blank. We did not have much time to investigate the issue, although we discovered that the RBS sequence taken from the registry

Ideally, we would replace the pBad promoter with a promoter that would trigger at the presence of the pathogen such as the pNorV promoter.
