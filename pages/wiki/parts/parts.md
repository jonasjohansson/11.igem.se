One of the biggest questions among researchers, policy makers and stakeholders regarding Phage Therapy is: how safe is it? Our team considers of extreme importance to understand the implications of this new therapy, and to integrate these concerns into our project to make sure we develop a treatment that is safe to use.

We have divided this question into two categories: 1- how safe it is to use temperate phages for Phage Therapy, and 2- how safe it is to treat patients using Esther

# About the safety of temperate phages - their effect on resistance

Temperate phages can be a source of genetic transduction (link to Esther, she helped to discover transduction), a rare occurrence in which, at the moment of encapsulation, bacterial DNA gets trapped in the bacteriophage’s capsule. If the phage then infects other bacteria and activates the lysogenic cycle, it can integrate DNA from the donor into the receptor, therefore providing new genes.

Transduction can be a vehicle to exchange resistance genes, or genes to increase the virulence of the receptor bacteria. Because of this, some researchers agree that temperate phages should not be used in phage therapy (1). For this reason, it was extremely important during our experimental design to make sure that the use of our phages does not contribute to the increase of antibiotic resistance or the virulence of the pathogen.

For this purpose, we contacted professor Graham F. Hatfull, first and only researcher up to date to engineer a temperate bacteriophage to be clinically used in the treatment of a patient with an antibiotic resistant infection of *Mycobacterium abscessus* (2). Even though he was not a specialist in bacteriophages infecting *Escherichia Coli*, he pointed us to some papers that were extremely helpful. For the treatment of this patient, they genetically modified the temperate phage Zoej and made it obligated lytic by removing its repressor gene 45, which was responsible for keeping the phage at the lysogenic cycle (3).

This gave us an idea for the design of our project (link to Design). The repressor protein for our P2 phage is the C protein. Moreover, it has been previously shown that removal of this protein will block the activation of the lysogenic cycle (4). By eliminating the C protein from our P2 phage, we make sure that it cannot enter the lysogenic cycle in another host, preventing transduction and the exchange of resistance genes.

# Humans & Esther – effects on health

Esther consists of two parts – the vehicle bacteria and the P2 phage (link to Project Design). It is important to evaluate the effects of these two types of organisms on human health separately, since they have different characteristics.

## The phage

We have all heard about the microbiome, but did you know that we also have a phageome? Bacteriophages are in fact one of the most common and diverse organism in our gut flora. Often, phages form symbiotic alliances with the microbiome to protect them against invasive pathogens. We can also find them adhere to mucus layers, providing us with an antimicrobial defense mechanism (5). Even though not all phages can be candidates for this role, these findings show that our bodies are already familiar with these organisms, whom they benefit from.

Esther delivers phages directly to the site of infection, in this case, the gut, were other phages are already present. Thus, it is important to understand what happens to the phages after they have been delivered to the intestine. An *in-vivo*study by Otero and colleagues, using fluorescence labeled phages encapsulated in a lipid vesicle and delivered orally, concludes that no bacteriophages could be observed in other organs or tissues other than those in the Gastro Intestinal track. Their experiments also show that non-encapsulated phages can easily cross the Gastro Intestinal barrier and accumulate in organs such as the liver or the kidneys, while encapsulated phages didn’t show significant accumulation (6).

Similarly, we will encapsulate our phages, but in this case, using a bacteria, that will keep the phage in a dormant state until it reaches the site of infection, increasing the localized concentration of phages and preventing its inactivation or filtration to other parts of the human body. Therefore, just as we have studied the safety concerns of phages, we should also consider what are the risks of our bacterial vehicle.

## The bacteria

The bacterial component in Esther will be used as a delivery method for the localized release of phages. The bacteria we have chosen to work with has been defined as a non-pathogenic strain of *Escherichia coli*called Nissle 1917 (EcN). It has been characterized as non-pathogenic because it lacks the capacity of producing pathogenic adhesion factors, enterotoxins and cytotoxins, which are commonly produced by its pathogenic counterparts (8).

Because exogenous bacteria can be the source of an inflammatory reaction, it is important to understand how the body react to the use of Esther. Studies shows that EcN does not exhibit toxicity after administration to germ – free mice and conventional mice (9); and in fact, it shows anti-inflammatory effects in sepsis-induced mice (10). Learn more about the benefits of *Escherichia coli*Nissle 1917 in our Outlook page. (Link to outlook page)

These results, however, are not applicable to certain mutations causing immunodeficiency (9), and therefore, it is important to consider the genetic background of the patient before administering Esther.

# Conclussions

As we have seen, either the use of phages nor _Escherichia coli_ Nissle 1917 have shown adverse effects so far. However, for our product to be proved safe, in-vivo studies should be perform. A good way to monitor the distribution of Esther throughout a mammalian body would be to mimic the experiment by Otero and colleagues, adding different fluorochrome tags to our vehicle bacteria and our phage. This would allow us to observe whether our Switch gets activated before it reaches the site of infection and weather E. coli Nissle can easily travel throughout the gut carrying the Switch plasmid.
