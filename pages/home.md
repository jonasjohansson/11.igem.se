Together we work towards the [Giant Jamboree](https://2019.igem.org/Main_Page) in Boston where we will present our project, which is currently in research at [AlbaNova](https://www.albanova.se/). Through the year we also work on several other facets of synthetic biology, we've hosted [ðŸ¥¼ Lab on Wheels](lab-on-wheels/) on several occasions, visited youth and taught them about synthetic biology in our [3 demo project](3-demo). We've also organised an [ðŸŽ¨ Art Exhibition](art-exhibition/). We are soon on our way to Vilnius to take part in a Biohackathon where the aim is to create a new digital invention for scientists.
