We're iGEM stockholm, an international team of students working towards the [Giant Jamboree](https://2019.igem.org/Main_Page) where we present our project, currently in research at [Albanova](https://www.albanova.se/). We also try to make positive change by education and participation and host several events through the year. We are soon on our way to Vilnius to take part in a Biohackathon where the aim is to create a new digital invention for scientists.
