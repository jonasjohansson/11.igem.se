We're iGEM stockholm, an international team of 17 students exploring the powers of synthetic biology and its potential for massive positive impact for health and environment 🌳. We are working with our main project towards the [Giant Jamboree](https://2019.igem.org/Main_Page) in Boston whilst making change through events that educate and inspire.
