Together we work towards the [Giant Jamboree](https://2019.igem.org/Main_Page) in Boston where we will present our project, currently in research at [AlbaNova](https://www.albanova.se/). Through the year we also work on several other facets of synthetic biology, we've hosted [🥼 Lab on Wheels](lab-on-wheels/) on several occasions, visited youth and taught them about synthetic biology in our [3 demo project](3-demo/). We've also organised an [🎨 Art Exhibition](art-exhibition/) in R1, an old nuclear reactor facility. We are soon on our way to Vilnius to take part in a Biohackathon where the aim is to create a new digital invention for scientists.
