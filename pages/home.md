Together we work towards the [Giant Jamboree](https://2019.igem.org/Main_Page) where we present our project, currently in research at [Albanova](https://www.albanova.se/). Through the year we've hosted our own [Lab on Wheels](lab-on-wheels/), inspired youth in the [3 demo](3-demo/) project, organised an [Art Exhibition](art-exhibition/) and facilitated a symposium on Bioethics and Biolegislation. We are soon on our way to Vilnius to take part in a Biohackathon where the aim is to create a new digital invention for scientists.
