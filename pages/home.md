Together we work towards the iGEM 2019 Giant Jamboree at Hynes Convention center in Boston where we will present our project. Through the year we also work on several other facets of synthetic biology, we've hosted [🥼 Lab on Wheels](lab-on-wheels/) on several occasions, visited youth and taught them about synthetic biology in our [3 demo project](3-demo). We've also organised an [🎨 Art Exhibition](art-exhibition/). We are soon on our way to Vilnius to take part in a Biohackathon where the aim is to create a new digital invention for scientists.
